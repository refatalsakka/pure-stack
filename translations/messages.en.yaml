  legal_basis_general_title: "General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on this Website"
  legal_basis_general_description: "If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data, insofar as this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. The data processing may also be carried out based on our legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy."

  data_transfer_notice_description: "We use tools from companies based in the USA or other countries that are not secure under data protection law. When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you, as the data subject, being able to take legal action against this. It is therefore possible that US authorities (e.g., intelligence services) may process, evaluate, and permanently store your data located on US servers for surveillance purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities."

  consent_revocation_title: "Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing"
  consent_revocation_description: "Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation."

  restriction_case2: "If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion."
  restriction_case3: "If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion."
